# CS303-Assignment-3


I created two different .h files, one for the stack problem and one for the queue. 
Each .h file had it's corresponding .cpp file and the checks were performed in the main file. 

I created a class object for the infix problem called em and issued it to read what the user input was. After that, the program displays if the user input aka the expression is valid or not. If it is valid then the program continues and converts the expression into a postfix format. If the expression is invalid, then the invalid message is displayed and the program ends.

For the second problem, I created a queue class object called numbers and performed two separate checks as shown below. In general, the class object has methods to add to the queue, check the size, get the top item of the queue, checks if the queue is empty, and removes the item at the front. These are all straight forward class functions. 

The checks are shown below.
